    /**
     *  Parameterized constructor creates a tree from an input image.
     *  Every leaf in the tree corresponds to a single pixel in the PNG.
     *  Every non-leaf node corresponds to a rectangle of pixels defined
     *  by upper, left, lower, and right image coordinates. A node will
     *  also store the average color over its defined rectangle. Note that
     *  this average MUST be freshly computed from the individual pixels in
     *  the image and NOT by computing a weighted average from the colors
     *  of its direct children, as this would lead to an accumulation of
     *  rounding errors due to the integer nature of RGB color channels.
     *  
     *  A non-leaf node's children correspond to a partition of the node's
     *  rectangle into two smaller rectangles, either by a horizontal line
     *  creating an upper rectangle and a lower rectangle, or a vertical line
     *  creating a left rectangle and a right rectangle.
     * 
     *  The split is determined as follows:
     *  1. If the current node's rectangle width is the same or larger than its height,
     *     then a vertical line will divide the rectangle into left and right rectangles.
     *     If the current node's rectangle width is smaller than its height,
     *     then a horizontal line will divide the rectangle into upper and lower rectangles.
     *  2. The coordinate of the dividing line is chosen such that combined sum squared
     *     deviations from the mean color in the left/upper and right/lower rectangles is minimal
     *     among all other potential dividing lines of the same orientation.
     *     e.g. for a region (0,0) to (3,2), the candidates are the vertical lines dividing the region into:
     *     - (0,0) to (0,2) and (1,0) to (3,2)
     *     - (0,0) to (1,2) and (2,0) to (3,2)
     *     - (0,0) to (2,2) and (3,2) to (3,2)
     *     The line which produces the minimal combined sum squared scores on the left
     *     and right will be used for the split.
     *  3. In the unlikely event that multiple candidates produce the same score, the one which
     *     most evenly splits the rectangular area will be chosen.
     *  4. In the even more unlikely even that two candidates produce the same score and produce
     *     the same minimal area difference, the one with the smaller coordinate will be chosen.
